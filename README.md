# Attendance Management System based on Face Recognition

This project is an Attendance Management System implemented using Python and face recognition techniques. The system allows users to automate the process of marking attendance by recognizing faces captured through a camera.

## Features

- Face detection and recognition: The system detects faces in images captured by a camera and recognizes them based on pre-trained face recognition models.
- Attendance marking: After recognizing faces, the system marks attendance for each recognized individual.
- Database integration: The attendance records are stored in a database, facilitating easy retrieval and management of attendance data.
- User-friendly interface: The system provides a user-friendly interface for administrators and users to interact with.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
